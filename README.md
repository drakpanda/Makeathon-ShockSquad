Smart Pillar:The lack of vision in steep locations caused by blind turns makes it challenging for drivers to determine if there is another vehicle rapidly approaching from the other end, according to the problem statement. Drivers may collide as a result, which can cause accidents.

The concept involves building a sensor-based system that would enable smart pillars or sensors to communicate with one another and alert vehicles of approaching vehicles from the other end in order to address this issue. An automatic alert/honking system that is activated dependent on the speed of the oncoming vehicle would accomplish this.
